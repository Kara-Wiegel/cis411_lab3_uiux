| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3  | ![alt text](image.png) The site was very inuitive, it was easy to use and find everything pretty easily. There weren't many buttons you could click on.  |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3  | ![alt text](image-1.png) There are lots of radio buttons to easily filter what jobs you are searching for. There is another buttons to view all filters, but the quick ones make it easy to find jobs.  |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2 | ![alt text](image-2.png)  | When you first create an account, it forces you to go through the minimum number of steps to get the most important information up for people to start finding you. But it didn't make you put some important stuff in right away which had to be added later. I have already had an account for a while, so this is going off memory.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  | ![alt text](image-3.png) As you start putting information in and search for specific fields, it starts reccomending jobs based on your searches on the home page. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 1  | ![alt text](image-4.png) ![ ](image-5.png)While most of the jobs that had an external applying link were word for word with the job externally. They at least including the link to the description.  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3  | ![alt text](image-6.png) Naivation of the website was super easy with not many links to go to. They were all straight forward and it was super easy to find what you want to get to fast. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3  | ![alt text](image-7.png) The touch version of the website on the phone was super nice and easy to use, even going as far to have an app (which I already had) for easier use.  |
| **TOTAL** | 16  |   |

## 2.3 Indeed

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 2  | ![alt text](image-8.png) Home page is the job search page as well, however, you have to find the exact working you want for the job with location. There are no filter buttons before searching. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 2  | ![alt text](image-9.png) There weren't many buttons and you can find what you are looking for quick. However, the job search bar you have to search one before you can filter. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 3  | ![alt text](image-10.png) easy to find information you need, whether it be jobs, company reviews or finding salaries for jobs you want. Everything important is found really quick.  |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2  | ![alt text](image-11.png) While it gives you jobs based on your activity, it is puts urgent or new jobs first that are kind of the same but not.  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3  | ![alt text](image-12.png) I tried finding this job on the company's website or out somewhere on the internet. But I couldn't find the job listed anywhere else but on Indeed  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 2  | ![alt text](image-13.png) While the buttons and finding things on the website were fairly easy. It was reading the jobs that was hard to navigate as there was no larger page to read it on. Only the samll side bar which if you scrolled wrong would send you scrolling down the jobs not the description. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3  | ![alt text](image-14.png) The website on my phone was so much easier to navigate and find things then the website on my computer. I could expand job descriptions and read it so much better.  |
| **TOTAL** | 17  |   |
